# Popular Divar Site

This is a test example of an intermediary site that I have created as the “frontend” of this site

*To test, move the backend folder to a higher level and then install the packages with the “npm i” command.

*Then run the server using “npm start” command

*The backend uses Swagger   -?  http://localhost:3000/swagger
